Your code explains the use of **logical operators** in Java, including `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT). These operators are used to evaluate boolean expressions and return a boolean result (`true` or `false`). I'll walk you through the key concepts and add more examples to help clarify how these operators work.

### Key Concepts of Logical Operators:

1. **`&&` (Logical AND)**:

   - The result is `true` only if **both** expressions are `true`. If one of the expressions is `false`, the entire expression becomes `false`.
   - Example: `true && true` returns `true`, but `true && false` returns `false`.
   - **Short-circuiting:** If the first expression is `false`, the evaluation stops because the result is already determined.

2. **`||` (Logical OR)**:

   - The result is `true` if **at least one** of the expressions is `true`. If both expressions are `false`, the entire expression becomes `false`.
   - Example: `true || false` returns `true`, but `false || false` returns `false`.
   - **Short-circuiting:** If the first expression is `true`, the evaluation stops because the result is already determined.

3. **`!` (Logical NOT)**:

   - This operator inverts the result of the expression. If the expression is `true`, `!true` becomes `false`, and vice versa.
   - Example: `!true` returns `false`, and `!false` returns `true`.

4. **Difference between `&&` and `&`**:
   - `&&` stops evaluation as soon as it encounters a `false` condition (short-circuiting), while `&` evaluates all conditions, even if one condition is already `false`.
   - The same applies to `||` and `|`: `||` short-circuits when it encounters a `true` condition, but `|` evaluates all conditions.

### Code Explanation:

```java
package j04_JavaOperators.ch04_LogicalOperators;

public class C01_LogicalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*
         Logical operators explained with examples:
         && (AND) and || (OR) operators with short-circuiting behavior.
        */

        // Declare boolean values
        boolean b1 = true;
        boolean b2 = false;

        // Declare integer values
        int a = 3;
        int b = 5;

        // AND operator
        System.out.println("b1 & (a < b) = " +  (b1 & (a < b)));  // true & true = true
        // Explanation: Both conditions are true, so the result is true.

        System.out.println("b2 && (a < b) = " + (b2 && (a < b)));  // false && true = false
        // Explanation: The first condition is false, so the result is false without evaluating the second condition (short-circuiting).

        // OR operator
        System.out.println("b1 || (a < b) = " + (b1 || (a < b)));  // true || true = true
        // Explanation: The first condition is true, so the result is true without evaluating the second condition (short-circuiting).

        System.out.println("b2 || (a < b) = " + (b2 || (a < b)));  // false || true = true
        // Explanation: The second condition is true, so the result is true.

        // NOT operator
        System.out.println("!b1 || (a > b) = " + !(b1 || (a > b)));  // !(true || false) = false
        // Explanation: The condition inside the parentheses is true (true || false), but the NOT operator (!) inverts it to false.

        // Additional examples with NOT
        System.out.println("b1 = " + b1);  // true
        System.out.println("!b1 = " + !b1);  // !true = false

        // Comparing `a` and `b` with inequality
        System.out.println("a != b = " + (a != b));  // true
        // Explanation: a (3) is not equal to b (5), so the result is true.
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Each Operation:

1. **`b1 & (a < b)`**:

   - `b1` is `true`, and `a < b` (3 < 5) is also `true`.
   - Both conditions are true, so the result is `true`.
   - **Output:** `b1 & (a < b) = true`.

2. **`b2 && (a < b)`**:

   - `b2` is `false`, and `a < b` is `true`.
   - Because `&&` short-circuits on `false`, it doesn't evaluate `a < b`. The result is `false`.
   - **Output:** `b2 && (a < b) = false`.

3. **`b1 || (a < b)`**:

   - `b1` is `true`, and `a < b` is `true`.
   - Because `||` short-circuits on `true`, it doesn't evaluate `a < b`. The result is `true`.
   - **Output:** `b1 || (a < b) = true`.

4. **`b2 || (a < b)`**:

   - `b2` is `false`, but `a < b` is `true`.
   - Because the second condition is true, the result is `true`.
   - **Output:** `b2 || (a < b) = true`.

5. **`!(b1 || (a > b))`**:

   - `b1` is `true`, and `a > b` (3 > 5) is `false`.
   - `true || false` evaluates to `true`, but the `!` operator inverts this, so the result is `false`.
   - **Output:** `!b1 || (a > b) = false`.

6. **`a != b`**:
   - `a` is 3, and `b` is 5.
   - Since 3 is not equal to 5, the result is `true`.
   - **Output:** `a != b = true`.

### Additional Example:

Let's include a more complex condition combining multiple logical operators:

```java
public class C01_LogicalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean x = true;
        boolean y = false;
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;

        // Complex condition using AND, OR, and NOT
        boolean result = (x || y) && !(a > b) && (a != b);

        // Step by step:
        // (x || y) --> true (because x is true)
        // !(a > b) --> true (because a is not greater than b)
        // (a != b) --> true (because a is not equal to b)
        // Final result: true && true && true --> true

        System.out.println("Complex condition result: " + result);  // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Complex Example:

- **`x || y`**: `x` is `true`, so `x || y` evaluates to `true`.
- **`!(a > b)`**: Since `a` (10) is not greater than `b` (20), `a > b` is `false`, and `!false` becomes `true`.
- **`a != b`**: `a` (10) is not equal to `b` (20), so this evaluates to `true`.
- The final expression becomes `true && true && true`, which evaluates to `true`.

### Summary:

- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns `true` only if both expressions are true. Short-circuits if one is false.
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Returns `true` if at least one expression is true. Short-circuits if one is true.
- **Logical NOT (`!`)**: Inverts the result of the expression.
- **Short-circuiting**: Stops evaluating as soon as the result is determined (for `&&` and `||`).
