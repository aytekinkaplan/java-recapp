Your code demonstrates arithmetic operations in Java, including the use of integers and the combination of strings with mathematical expressions. I'll explain each line of the output to make sure you understand what's happening.

### Code Explanation:

```java
package j04_JavaOperators.ch01_ArithmeticOperators;

public class C01_ArithmeticOperator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare and initialize variables
        int a = 10;
        int b = 3;
        int c = 7;

        // Perform arithmetic operations and print the result
        System.out.println(b + a * c);  // Multiplication happens first, then addition
        System.out.println(c - a / (c - b) + a * b);  // Division, subtraction, and multiplication

        // Declare and initialize more variables, including a string
        int g = 2;
        int h = 3;
        String str = "Java";

        // String concatenation with arithmetic operations
        System.out.println((h + h) + str + " " + (g * h) + " " + (g - h));
    }
}
```

### Output Explanation:

1. **First Expression:**

   ```java
   System.out.println(b + a * c);
   ```

   - This evaluates as: `b + (a * c)` because multiplication has higher precedence than addition.
   - `a * c = 10 * 7 = 70`
   - `b + 70 = 3 + 70 = 73`
   - **Output:**
     ```
     73
     ```

2. **Second Expression:**

   ```java
   System.out.println(c - a / (c - b) + a * b);
   ```

   - First, `c - b` is evaluated: `7 - 3 = 4`
   - Then, `a / (c - b)` becomes `10 / 4 = 2` (integer division).
   - After that, multiplication `a * b = 10 * 3 = 30`.
   - Now, the full expression: `c - 2 + 30 = 7 - 2 + 30 = 35`
   - **Output:**
     ```
     35
     ```

3. **Third Expression:**
   ```java
   System.out.println((h + h) + str + " " + (g * h) + " " + (g - h));
   ```
   - This involves both arithmetic and string concatenation.
   - `h + h = 3 + 3 = 6`
   - Then the string concatenation happens: `"6Java "`.
   - Next, `g * h = 2 * 3 = 6`, so the string becomes: `"6Java 6 "`.
   - Finally, `g - h = 2 - 3 = -1`, so the final string is: `"6Java 6 -1"`
   - **Output:**
     ```
     6Java 6 -1
     ```

### Key Points:

1. **Operator Precedence:** Multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction unless parentheses dictate otherwise.
2. **String Concatenation:** When integers are concatenated with a string, the integers are converted to strings, and the result is concatenated as text.
3. **Integer Division:** In Java, dividing two integers results in an integer, where the decimal part is truncated (not rounded).
