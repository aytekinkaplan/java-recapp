Hereâ€™s the improved version of your Java code along with a detailed explanation in English.

### **Improved Code:**

```java
package ch02_DataTypes_WrapperClass.tasks02;

public class _01_create_int2 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        /*
            TASK:
            Create an integer variable with a value of 100
            and print this variable to the console.
         */

        // Declare and initialize an integer variable with a value of 100
        int number = 100;

        // Print the value of the variable to the console
        System.out.println("The value of the number is: " + number);

    }
}
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Declaration and Initialization of an Integer Variable**:

   - The line `int number = 100;` declares a variable named `number` of type `int` (which stands for integer) and assigns it the value `100`.
   - In Java, `int` is a data type used to store whole numbers (both positive and negative) without decimals. The range of `int` is from `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`.

2. **Using the `System.out.println()` Method**:

   - The line `System.out.println("The value of the number is: " + number);` is used to print the value of the variable `number` to the console.
   - The `+` operator is used for **concatenation**, meaning it joins the string `"The value of the number is: "` with the value of the `number` variable.
   - The result will be something like:
     ```
     The value of the number is: 100
     ```

3. **Why We Use Variables**:

   - In programming, **variables** allow us to store data values that we can use and manipulate throughout the program.
   - Declaring an `int` like this is common when you need to store numbers for calculations or logical operations in your code.

4. **Improvements**:
   - The comment block is clearer with a well-defined task description.
   - The print statement includes a descriptive message, making the output more readable and informative.

### **Additional Example**:

```java
public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declaring two integer variables
        int age = 25;
        int year = 2024;

        // Printing both variables
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
    }
}
```

- In this example, we declare two integer variables, `age` and `year`, and print them. The output will be:
  ```
  Age: 25
  Year: 2024
  ```

### **Key Takeaways**:

- **Variable Declaration**: `int number = 100;` is used to declare and initialize a variable.
- **Print Statement**: `System.out.println()` is used to display output.
- **Integer Type**: `int` is used for whole numbers in Java.

This structure is more informative and introduces good coding practices for naming and commenting in code.
