The provided code demonstrates the creation, assignment, and usage of variables in Java. Let’s break down the key components and explain how each part works.

### **Understanding the Code:**

1. **Variables in Java:**

   - **Variables** are reserved areas in memory to store data. They act as containers for values that a program uses.
   - **Data types** in Java define what type of value a variable can hold. Examples include:
     - `int` for integers (whole numbers)
     - `double` for floating-point numbers (decimals)
     - `boolean` for true/false values
     - `String` for text.

2. **Basic Syntax for Variable Declaration:**
   - **Syntax:**
     ```java
     DataType variableName = value;
     ```
     For example:
     ```java
     int age = 48;
     ```
     This statement declares a variable `age` of type `int` and initializes it with the value `48`.

### **Explanation of Code Sections:**

1. **Variable Declaration and Initialization:**

   - The variable `age` is declared and initialized in one step:
     ```java
     int age = 48;
     ```
   - Similarly, `salary` is also declared and initialized:
     ```java
     int salary = 33000;
     ```
   - These variables are printed using `System.out.println()`. This is how Java prints the value of variables to the console:
     ```java
     System.out.println(age);   // Outputs: 48
     System.out.println(salary); // Outputs: 33000
     ```

2. **Declaring a Variable Without Initializing It:**

   - A variable can be declared without immediately assigning it a value, but it must be initialized before it can be used:
     ```java
     int height;
     height = 175;  // Now the variable is initialized
     ```
   - If you try to use a variable before assigning it a value, it will result in a **compile-time error (CTE)**.

3. **Declaring Multiple Variables in a Single Statement:**

   - Multiple variables of the same type can be declared in a single line:
     ```java
     int dailyWage, personAge, weight;
     ```
   - They can be initialized later:
     ```java
     personAge = 33;
     dailyWage = 1000;
     weight = 99;
     ```

4. **Reassigning Variable Values:**

   - Variables can be reassigned new values after their initial assignment:
     ```java
     int dailyIncome = 1500;
     dailyIncome = 1800;  // The value of dailyIncome is now 1800
     ```
   - This demonstrates that variables can hold different values throughout the lifecycle of the program.

5. **Scope of Variables:**
   - Variables can only be declared once within the same scope (e.g., inside the same method). If you try to declare a variable with the same name again, it will cause a **duplicate declaration error**:
     ```java
     // int personAge;  // This would cause a compile-time error (CTE) because personAge was already declared
     ```

### **Additional Examples:**

1. **Performing Arithmetic Operations:**

   - You can use variables in arithmetic operations:
     ```java
     int num1 = 5, num2 = 10;
     int sum = num1 + num2;
     System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);  // Output: Sum: 15
     ```

2. **Reassigning and Printing New Values:**

   - Example showing reassignment of a variable:
     ```java
     int temperature = 25;
     System.out.println("Initial Temperature: " + temperature);  // Output: 25
     temperature = 30;
     System.out.println("Updated Temperature: " + temperature);  // Output: 30
     ```

3. **Working with Boolean Values:**
   - Boolean variables store `true` or `false` values:
     ```java
     boolean isRaining = false;
     System.out.println("Is it raining? " + isRaining);  // Output: Is it raining? false
     isRaining = true;
     System.out.println("Is it raining now? " + isRaining);  // Output: Is it raining now? true
     ```

### **Important Concepts:**

- **Assignment Operator (`=`)**:
  - This operator assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. For example, `int age = 48;` assigns the value `48` to the variable `age`.
- **Concatenation (`+`)**:
  - The `+` operator is used to concatenate (join) strings and variables. For example, `"Temperature: " + temperature` combines the string with the value of `temperature`.
- **Scope**:
  - A variable is only valid within the block it is declared. If it’s declared inside a method, it cannot be used outside of that method.

### **Output Example:**

Here’s what the output would look like when you run the code:

```text
age
48
33000
Starting salary for Ms. Nur: 33000
Your height: 175
1500
Updated daily income: 1800
Daily income: 1800, Year: 2022, Age: 48, Daily wage: 1000, Weight: 99
Sum: 15
Initial Temperature: 25
Updated Temperature: 30
Is it raining? false
Is it raining now? true
```

### **Conclusion:**

- **Variable Declaration and Initialization**: You must declare a variable and initialize it before using it.
- **Reassignment**: Variables can be reassigned new values, but they can only be declared once in the same scope.
- **Scope**: The scope of a variable defines where it can be used. Variables declared inside a method are only accessible within that method.
- **Printing Variables**: Use `System.out.println()` to print variable values and combine them with text for more meaningful output.

This explanation covers all the fundamental concepts of variable creation, assignment, reassignment, and scope in Java. Understanding these basics is essential for writing effective Java programs.
