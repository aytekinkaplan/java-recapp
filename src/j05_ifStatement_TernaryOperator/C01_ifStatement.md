This Java code is a simple demonstration of conditional statements (if-statements) using comparisons between two variables, `ageOfMeryem` and `ageOfAhmet`, which represent the ages of two people. Let's break it down:

1. **Variable Declaration and Initialization**:

   - The variable `ageOfMeryem` is assigned the value `35`, representing Meryem's age.
   - The variable `ageOfAhmet` is assigned the value `30`, representing Ahmet's age.

2. **First If-Statement**:

   ```java
   if (ageOfMeryem == ageOfAhmet) {
       System.out.println("Meryem and Ahmet are the same age.");
   }
   ```

   - This if-statement checks if the age of Meryem is **equal** to the age of Ahmet.
   - If both ages are the same, it prints: "Meryem and Ahmet are the same age."
   - Since `ageOfMeryem` is 35 and `ageOfAhmet` is 30, this condition is **false**, and the message will **not** be printed.

3. **Second If-Statement**:

   ```java
   if (ageOfMeryem > 40) {
       System.out.println("Meryem is older than 40.");
   }
   ```

   - This if-statement checks if Meryem's age is **greater than 40**.
   - If Meryem is older than 40, it prints: "Meryem is older than 40."
   - Since `ageOfMeryem` is 35, this condition is also **false**, and the message will **not** be printed.

4. **Third If-Statement**:
   ```java
   if (ageOfAhmet + ageOfMeryem > 60) {
       System.out.println("Meryem and Ahmet are older than 60.");
   }
   ```
   - This if-statement checks if the **sum** of Meryem's age and Ahmet's age is **greater than 60**.
   - If their combined ages exceed 60, it prints: "Meryem and Ahmet are older than 60."
   - The sum of their ages is `35 + 30 = 65`, which is **greater than 60**, so this condition is **true**, and the message will be printed.

### Output:

- The only message that will be printed is:
  ```
  Meryem and Ahmet are older than 60.
  ```

In summary, this code demonstrates basic `if` conditions based on age comparisons, and only the third condition (sum of their ages being greater than 60) is true, so it prints the relevant message.
