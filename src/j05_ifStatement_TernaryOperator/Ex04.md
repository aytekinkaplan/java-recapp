### Code Structure Explanation

```java
package j05_ifStatement_TernaryOperator;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Ex04 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*
         Task:
         Create a program that checks if the first character of a given input is a letter.
         */

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a phrase: ");

        char firstCharacter = input.next().charAt(0); // Get the first character of the input string

        // Check if the first character is a letter (using ASCII values)
        if ((firstCharacter >= 'A' && firstCharacter <= 'Z') || (firstCharacter >= 'a' && firstCharacter <= 'z')) {
            System.out.println("The first character '" + firstCharacter + "' is a letter.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The first character '" + firstCharacter + "' is not a letter.");
        }

        // Close the Scanner to free up resources
        input.close();
    }
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Package and Class Definition**:

   - This code is inside a package named `j05_ifStatement_TernaryOperator`.
   - The main functionality is defined in the class `Ex04`. In Java, every piece of code must be inside a class, and the `main` method is the entry point of the program where execution begins.

2. **Getting Input with Scanner**:

   ```java
   Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
   System.out.print("Enter a phrase: ");
   ```

   - Here, a `Scanner` object named `input` is created to get input from the user, with `System.in` specifying that input will be taken from the console.
   - `System.out.print("Enter a phrase: ");` displays a prompt asking the user to enter a phrase.

3. **Getting the First Character**:

   ```java
   char firstCharacter = input.next().charAt(0);
   ```

   - `input.next()` retrieves the first word from the input as a `String`.
   - `.charAt(0)` extracts the first character of this `String` at index `0`.
   - The first character is then stored in the `firstCharacter` variable.

4. **Letter Check (Using ASCII Values)**:

   ```java
   if ((firstCharacter >= 'A' && firstCharacter <= 'Z') || (firstCharacter >= 'a' && firstCharacter <= 'z'))
   ```

   - This `if` statement checks if `firstCharacter` is a letter.
   - In Java, `char` values can be compared using ASCII values, allowing us to check if `firstCharacter` is within the ranges:
     - `'A'` to `'Z'` (uppercase letters) with ASCII values from `65` to `90`.
     - `'a'` to `'z'` (lowercase letters) with ASCII values from `97` to `122`.
   - If `firstCharacter` falls within either of these ranges, it is a letter, and the program outputs `"The first character is a letter."`.

5. **If Not a Letter (Else Statement)**:

   ```java
   else {
       System.out.println("The first character '" + firstCharacter + "' is not a letter.");
   }
   ```

   - If the `if` condition is not met, meaning the first character is not a letter, the `else` block executes.
   - This block prints `"The first character is not a letter."`, notifying the user.

6. **Closing the Scanner**:
   ```java
   input.close();
   ```
   - `input.close();` closes the `Scanner` object, releasing resources. It’s a good programming practice to close the `Scanner` or other input streams after use to free up memory.

### Code Execution Flow

The program prompts the user to enter a phrase, retrieves the first character, and checks if it is a letter. The check is based on the ASCII range of uppercase and lowercase letters. Finally, it outputs whether the first character is a letter or not, and then releases the `Scanner` resources.
