Your code is functional but can be improved for better readability and structure. Additionally, I'll provide an English explanation of how it works.

### Improved Code:

```java
package j01_Variables;

public class HelloWorld {

    /*
        PROJECT CREATION:
        File -> New -> Project -> Next -> Name (Enter the name of the project, start with lowercase, e.g., javaPractice103104105) -> Finish.

        PACKAGE CREATION:
        Right-click on the Java folder -> New -> Package -> Enter the desired package name (start with lowercase, e.g., day01_variables).

        CLASS CREATION:
        Right-click on the created package -> New -> Class -> Enter the class name (start with uppercase, e.g., C01_Variables).
    */

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // main method is like the engine of a car. Everything inside must be "static" to be used here.

        // Single-line comments start with "//" and are ignored by the Java compiler.

        /*
         * Multi-line comments are written between "/*" and "*\/". Java ignores everything in this section.
         */

        // TASK: Print name, age, hometown, and profession to the console.

        System.out.print("My name: John Doe"); // prints text, but stays on the same line.
        System.out.println(" Age: 30"); // prints text and moves to the next line.
        System.out.println("Hometown: New York");
        System.out.println("Profession: Java Developer");

        /*
         * Trick:
         * - "print" continues printing on the same line.
         * - "println" moves to the next line after printing.
         * - Every statement in Java must end with a semicolon ";", otherwise it results in a compile-time error (CTE).
         */
    }

    // Comments can be added outside of the main method as well.
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Package Declaration**: `package j01_Variables;`

   - This line specifies that the class belongs to the `j01_Variables` package.
   - Packages are a way to organize related classes together.

2. **Class Declaration**: `public class HelloWorld`

   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects and contains methods and variables.
   - Here, the class name is `HelloWorld`, which should start with an uppercase letter (a Java convention).

3. **Main Method**: `public static void main(String[] args)`

   - This is the entry point for any Java application.
   - When you run the program, the code inside the `main` method gets executed.
   - The `main` method must be `public`, `static`, and return `void` with the exact argument `String[] args`.

4. **Comments**:

   - Single-line comments (`//`) are used to explain a single line of code.
   - Multi-line comments (`/* ... */`) are used to comment on multiple lines.
   - Comments are ignored by the Java compiler, making them useful for documenting your code.

5. **Print Statements**:

   - `System.out.print()` prints text on the same line.
   - `System.out.println()` prints text and then moves to the next line.
   - The code inside `main` prints the name, age, hometown, and profession to the console.

6. **Tricks and Tips**:
   - The `print` vs. `println` explanation is given in comments to clarify that `println` moves to a new line, while `print` continues on the same line.
   - A reminder to always use a semicolon `;` at the end of every statement to avoid compilation errors (CTE).

### Improvements:

1. **Clear Documentation**: The comments have been translated to English for global readability.
2. **Task Breakdown**: The task explanation and print statements are concise and structured.
3. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Package and class names follow Java naming conventions.

This updated structure is more organized and easier to understand for anyone reading the code.
