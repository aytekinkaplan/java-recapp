Here is your code in English with a detailed explanation of each part, and I've added input validation to ensure the user enters a valid response ("yes" or "no").

### Code:

```java
package j03_ScannerClass_TypeCasting.tasks;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class _28_Scanner7 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        /* Create a boolean.
           Ask the user "Do you have a bank account?".
           If the user responds with "yes", set the boolean to true.
           If the user responds with "no", set the boolean to false.
           Print the boolean. */

        // Step 1: Create a Scanner object to read user input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 2: Initialize variables for input validation and storing the user's response
        boolean isValidInput = false;  // This will be used to check if the input is valid
        boolean isThereBankAccount = false;  // This will store the final value based on the user's response

        // Step 3: Ask the user if they have a bank account and validate the input
        while (!isValidInput) {
            try {
                // Step 4: Prompt the user with the question
                System.out.println("Do you have a bank account? (yes/no): ");
                String userResponse = scanner.nextLine().trim().toLowerCase();  // Normalize the input

                // Step 5: Validate the input and set the boolean value
                if (userResponse.equals("yes")) {
                    isThereBankAccount = true;  // Set to true if the user has a bank account
                    isValidInput = true;  // Exit the loop since the input is valid
                } else if (userResponse.equals("no")) {
                    isThereBankAccount = false;  // Set to false if the user does not have a bank account
                    isValidInput = true;  // Exit the loop since the input is valid
                } else {
                    // If the input is invalid, throw an exception
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.");
                }

            } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
                // Step 6: Handle invalid input by showing an error message
                System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            }
        }

        // Step 7: Print the result based on the boolean value
        System.out.println("User's bank account status: " + (isThereBankAccount ? "Has a bank account" : "No bank account"));

        // Step 8: Close the scanner to prevent memory leaks
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Creating the `Scanner` Object:**

   - `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);`
   - This line creates a `Scanner` object to capture user input from the console.

2. **Input Validation Setup:**

   - `boolean isValidInput = false;` and `boolean isThereBankAccount = false;`
   - These variables are used to track whether the user has provided valid input (`isValidInput`) and to store the final answer to whether they have a bank account (`isThereBankAccount`).

3. **The `while` Loop:**

   - The `while (!isValidInput)` loop ensures that the user is continuously prompted for input until they provide a valid response (`yes` or `no`).

4. **User Input:**

   - `String userResponse = scanner.nextLine().trim().toLowerCase();`
   - This line captures the user's input and normalizes it by removing leading or trailing spaces (`trim()`) and converting it to lowercase (`toLowerCase()`). This helps make the input case-insensitive (i.e., the user can enter "YES", "yes", "Yes", etc.).

5. **Input Validation:**

   - The `if-else` block checks if the user has entered either "yes" or "no". If the input is "yes", the boolean `isThereBankAccount` is set to `true`. If the input is "no", the boolean is set to `false`.
   - If the input is not valid, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with an error message.

6. **Handling Invalid Input:**

   - The `catch (IllegalArgumentException e)` block catches the exception and prints the error message (`"Invalid input. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'."). The user is then prompted to re-enter their response.

7. **Printing the Result:**

   - `System.out.println("User's bank account status: " + (isThereBankAccount ? "Has a bank account" : "No bank account"));`
   - This line prints the user's bank account status based on the value of `isThereBankAccount`. The ternary operator (`? :`) is used to print either "Has a bank account" or "No bank account" depending on whether the boolean is `true` or `false`.

8. **Closing the `Scanner`:**
   - `scanner.close();`
   - It’s good practice to close the `Scanner` object to release system resources and prevent memory leaks.

### Final Output Example:

Here’s an example of the program's output based on user input:

```
Do you have a bank account? (yes/no):
yes
User's bank account status: Has a bank account

Do you have a bank account? (yes/no):
no
User's bank account status: No bank account

Do you have a bank account? (yes/no):
maybe
Invalid input. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.
```

### Key Points:

1. **Input Validation:** The code ensures that the user can only enter valid responses (`yes` or `no`). If they enter anything else, they are prompted to try again.
2. **User-Friendly Error Handling:** The program handles invalid inputs gracefully by showing an error message and asking the user to try again.
3. **Boolean Handling:** The boolean value `isThereBankAccount` is dynamically set based on the user's input, and this value is used to print the appropriate message.

This version improves user interaction by validating input and providing a user-friendly experience. Let me know if you’d like to add more features or need further clarification!
