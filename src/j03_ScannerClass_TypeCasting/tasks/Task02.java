         * Get the user's height in cm and weight in kilograms
         * Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI).
         * Print the result as both an integer and a decimal number.
         *
         * BMI formula = weight / (height * height)
         * Note: Weight should be in kilograms and height should be in meters.
         *
         * Example:
         * Input : height :180 cm, weight : 80 kg
         * Output: Your BMI is: 24
         *         Your BMI is: 24.691â€¦
