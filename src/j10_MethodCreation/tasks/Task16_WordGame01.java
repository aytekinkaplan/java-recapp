         * 1- Initially, ask the first player to enter a word and display it.
         *
         * 2- Once player 1 enters a word, ask player 2 if they accept it.
         *    - If player 2 accepts, add the length of the word as points to player 1 and proceed to step 3.
         *    - If player 2 rejects the word, display "Invalid word" and declare player 1 as the winner, then end the game.
         *
         * 3- Ask the new player if they want to continue playing.
         *    - If they do, ask for a string to add to the word and whether to add it at the beginning or the end.
         *      Add the chosen string to the word and return to step 2.
         *    - If they donâ€™t want to continue, display "Game Over", print both players' scores, and declare the winner.
